* [Solving Mathematical Problems: A Personal Perspective](https://amzn.to/3RLBVek), _Terence Tao_ 
   
   'Live walk-throughs' that demonstrates how 15-year-old Terence Tao approached problem solving on many Math-Olympiad-level problems.

* [Analysis 1](https://amzn.to/3fVsc7V), _Terence Tao_ 
   
   For undergraduate students or self-learners who want to learn Analysis. Also for those who would like to gain insight into how Terence Tao thinks and have sufficient background knowledge to understand Analysis.
   
* [I Want to Be A Mathematician](https://amzn.to/3RPjiG6), _Paul Halmos_ 
   
   Full of gems on how to learn mathematics. However, this is mostly an autobiography, so take that into consideration.


This is a running list. This means that if I come across other worthwhile books and resources, I will add them here.
